  <div class="documentation__col">
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>Carousels show a collection of items one at a time. They are also known as “slideshows” and “sliders”. Typical uses of carousels include scrolling news headlines, featured articles on home pages, and image galleries. This carousel has been adapted from the following example: <a href= "https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/carousels/">Web Accessibility Tutorials / Carousels</a>.</p>
    <p>This carousel includes modifier classes to accomodate various types of content:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>carousel--image</code> should be added to the outer container when the carousel includes only images.</li>
      <li><code>carousel--image-text</code> should be added to the outer container when the carousel includes images with text.</li>
      <li><code>carousel--text</code> should be added to the outer container when the carousel includes text-only content.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the carousel is configured to include additional navigation buttons below the slides, <code>has-slidenav</code> will be added to the outermost container.</p>
    <h3>JavaScript Configuration Settings</h3>
    <p>This carousel comes with the following settings that can be configured in the accompanying JavaScript file:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>slidenav</code>: Set this attribute to <code>true</code> to add additional navigation buttons for each item in the carousel, allowing screen reader users to get an overview of carousel content, where they are in the sequence and will enable them to navigate directly to any item.</li>
      <li><code>animate</code>: Set this attribute to <code>true</code> to include a play/stop button in the slide navigation. Otherwise, it should be set to <code>false</code>. </li>
      <li><code>startAnimated</code>: Set this attribute to <code>true</code> to autoplay the carousel on page load. Otherwise, it should be set to <code>false</code>.</li>
      <li><code>announceItem</code>: Set this attribute to <code>true</code> to include an <code>aria-live="polite"</code> attribute on the carousel navigation, informing screen reader users what item is currently active.</li>
