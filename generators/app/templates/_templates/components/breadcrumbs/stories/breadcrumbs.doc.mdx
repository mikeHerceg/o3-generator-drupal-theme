## Documentaion

### Usage
Breadcrumbs are used to track and display where the user is in the hierarchy of the current page, relative to the structure of the website.

### Labelling Expectations
Each breadcrumb list should be contained in a nav element with `aria-label=“breadcrumb”`
The current page in the breadcrumb list should have an `aria-current` attribute.

### Focus Expectations
Every link should have a visible keyboard focus state
Keyboard Expectations
`Tab` = Move to next focusable element
`Enter` = Navigate to focused link

### Screen Reader Expectations
When interacting with breadcrumb navigation, screen readers should announce the following information:
- The navigation by name as defined in the aria-label.
- Breadcrumb links when focused.

### Tab Order Expectations
When navigating the breadcrumb list, the following tab order is expected:

1. Each tab keypress will advance to the next link in the list.
2. The current page's list item will not be included in the tab list, since it is not an active link.
